Hello, my name is Amy LaViers and welcome 
to our first of seven glue lectures. 
The point of this lecture, and we're 
going to do one each week, 
is to connect what Dr. 
Egerstedt has done in the lectures to the 
quizzes for each week. 
So here, you'll get helpful hints about 
the quizzes and we'll kind of clarify and 
repeat a few key concepts. 
so this is just meant to help you. 
We'll do one a week and also be 
moderating Q&A forums if you have further 
questions or need more guidance in the, 
in the course material. 
So here, this is the first Glue Lecture 
and we're going to be covering Dynamical 
Models today and this is really tailored 
to help with quiz one. 
So [COUGH] I want to start with a picture 
of how we've kind of first are introduced 
to derivatives. 
We typically think of, you know, if we 
have this function x=t^2, we think of 
this graph where we have x here on the 
y-axis and t here on the x-axis. 
And we think of this function as kind of 
a line on a graph and we know if we take 
the derivative of t^2, we get 2t, 
we get this straight line now for the 
first derivative, 
and then our second derivative, which 
sort of see this straight line. 
And so, this is definitely a useful way 
of thinking about derivitaves, 
but in this, in this lecture I want us to 
kind of go beyond these lines on a graph 
and think of these equations as 
describing something that's moving. 
So I'm going to replay this once. 
Here, we have this ball moving in space, 
right? Now, the axis don't mean anything 
necessarily and we just have this 
animation that it's moving or we can 
think of our position here as x according 
to t^2. 
So, we can think of this as our axis, we 
have this one single axis, 
and the, the way that the ball is moving 
is described by these equations here on 
the left. 
And we can kind of ask the question of 
how does the ball know how to move? So if 
these equations are describing the 
movement that we're seeing and we can 
think of this as a system kind of what's 
going on? So to look at that, let's 
imagine our ball in a discrete world. 
And we can remember from lecture that we 
can figure out how these continuous 
equations translate into discrete time 
using this taylor first order taylor 
approximation. 
Let's choose our delta t to be 0.5 
seconds, and now, we can take this 
previous system, where we had x dot 
equals 2t. 
We can figure out what the equation in 
discrete time is to describe how the ball 
should move. 
So, here, we have this. 
We can think of it as an update equation, 
right? The next state is given by this 
equation and it's a function of the 
current state. 
So, to see how the ball moves, let's 
increment k. 
We started here at zero, now k=1, 
we take the past state, and we add the 
current value of k. 
Again, if we increment k to 2, we can see 
that we take our past state, we add two, 
we get, 
we're now at x=3, right? And so forth. 
So again, if we do it, and we can see 
that, as we move, the ball is moving 
fast, you know, more blocks each time, 
so it's moving faster and faster. And 
back to continuous time, we can see that 
this is actually the equation that tell 
us how the ball is moving. 
It's speeding up as it goes along and 
it's moving according to this equation x 
dot, and this, is a dynamical model. 
In addition to this description, this 
update rule, this differential equation, 
if we have an initial condition, so we 
know where our ball needs to start. 
Let's see if I can play this again. 
We see that, this is what happens, 
and so, we think of this as a dynamical 
model and this is how we want to think 
about differential equations in this 
course. 
So, an example. 
What should we see when we see this? The 
first thing to do when we see a plot is 
always look at the axis. 
We can see here that this is x versus 
time. 
We can see that we start at some non-zero 
initial condition and we can see that 
when that happens, we start to move and 
we move kind of, we, we don't move in a, 
at a constant rate, right? 
If we moved at a constant rate, we would 
see this straight line, but we can see 
that actually what's happening is we're 
speeding up as we go, as time increases, 
and so, we can infer certain things about 
what x dot looks like, then. 
Right? So x dot is going to be something 
that increases with time. 
And, in fact, here, what we have is that 
x dot is 2t. 
So this is at a plot that we just saw 
animated with the pink ball. 
So, next, what we might see, is we might 
be presented with a,a dynamical model. 
What should be think when we see this? 
Well, first of all, these x of t's, 
we'll sometimes just write them as x as a 
sort of shorthand. 
And, what we can try to ask about this 
model is what does x of t look like? So, 
what's the trajectory described by this 
system? And, what happens at time equal 
to infinity, right? And that means, what 
happens after a long time to this system? 
So, if we want to find x of t, we just 
need to integrate our differential 
equation or sometimes what we can do is 
just guess a trajectory a form for x of 
t, and then check, and the way you check 
is just by differentiating. 
So here, this is pretty easy, right? 
We can see that when we differentiate 
x^2/2, we get x. 
So this is the form of x of t. 
It's going to be some kind of problem, 
right? 
And the second thing that we might ask 
this idea of what happens long term to 
the system is just a matter of 
considering what happens when x stops 
moving? 
Because when x stops moving, we're stuck, 
right? That's where our system ends up. 
So, if we plug in what it means for x to 
stop moving is for x dot to be zero. 
If we plug this in to our dynamical 
system, 
we find that that means that x=0. 
So long term with this system, what's 
going to happen is x is going to rest at 
zero and we call this an equilibrium 
point, 
because the system isn't moving at this 
point. 
So, that wraps up our lecture. 
good luck with Quiz 1, and I'll see you 
at the forums.

00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,687
Hello, my name is Amy LaViers and welcome 
to our first of seven glue lectures. 

2
00:00:04,687 --> 00:00:08,222
The point of this lecture, and we're 
going to do one each week, 

3
00:00:08,222 --> 00:00:12,327
is to connect what Dr. 
Egerstedt has done in the lectures to the 

4
00:00:12,327 --> 00:00:16,122
quizzes for each week. 
So here, you'll get helpful hints about 

5
00:00:16,122 --> 00:00:20,362
the quizzes and we'll kind of clarify and 
repeat a few key concepts. 

6
00:00:20,362 --> 00:00:24,957
so this is just meant to help you. 
We'll do one a week and also be 

7
00:00:24,957 --> 00:00:31,155
moderating Q&A forums if you have further 
questions or need more guidance in the, 

8
00:00:31,155 --> 00:00:35,353
in the course material. 
So here, this is the first Glue Lecture 

9
00:00:35,353 --> 00:00:40,894
and we're going to be covering Dynamical 
Models today and this is really tailored 

10
00:00:40,894 --> 00:00:45,895
to help with quiz one. 
So [COUGH] I want to start with a picture 

11
00:00:45,895 --> 00:00:50,394
of how we've kind of first are introduced 
to derivatives. 

12
00:00:50,394 --> 00:00:56,601
We typically think of, you know, if we 
have this function x=t^2, we think of 

13
00:00:56,601 --> 00:01:02,103
this graph where we have x here on the 
y-axis and t here on the x-axis. 

14
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:06,757
And we think of this function as kind of 
a line on a graph and we know if we take 

15
00:01:06,757 --> 00:01:11,269
the derivative of t^2, we get 2t, 
we get this straight line now for the 

16
00:01:11,269 --> 00:01:14,375
first derivative, 
and then our second derivative, which 

17
00:01:14,375 --> 00:01:18,569
sort of see this straight line. 
And so, this is definitely a useful way 

18
00:01:18,569 --> 00:01:23,262
of thinking about derivitaves, 
but in this, in this lecture I want us to 

19
00:01:23,262 --> 00:01:28,336
kind of go beyond these lines on a graph 
and think of these equations as 

20
00:01:28,336 --> 00:01:32,797
describing something that's moving. 
So I'm going to replay this once. 

21
00:01:32,797 --> 00:01:38,163
Here, we have this ball moving in space, 
right? Now, the axis don't mean anything 

22
00:01:38,163 --> 00:01:43,237
necessarily and we just have this 
animation that it's moving or we can 

23
00:01:43,237 --> 00:01:47,207
think of our position here as x according 
to t^2. 

24
00:01:47,207 --> 00:01:53,194
So, we can think of this as our axis, we 
have this one single axis, 

25
00:01:53,194 --> 00:01:59,415
and the, the way that the ball is moving 
is described by these equations here on 

26
00:01:59,415 --> 00:02:02,567
the left. 
And we can kind of ask the question of 

27
00:02:02,567 --> 00:02:07,121
how does the ball know how to move? So if 
these equations are describing the 

28
00:02:07,121 --> 00:02:12,152
movement that we're seeing and we can 
think of this as a system kind of what's 

29
00:02:12,152 --> 00:02:16,732
going on? So to look at that, let's 
imagine our ball in a discrete world. 

30
00:02:16,732 --> 00:02:22,815
And we can remember from lecture that we 
can figure out how these continuous 

31
00:02:22,815 --> 00:02:28,898
equations translate into discrete time 
using this taylor first order taylor 

32
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:32,788
approximation. 
Let's choose our delta t to be 0.5 

33
00:02:32,788 --> 00:02:37,420
seconds, and now, we can take this 
previous system, where we had x dot 

34
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:39,778
equals 2t. 
We can figure out what the equation in 

35
00:02:39,778 --> 00:02:42,930
discrete time is to describe how the ball 
should move. 

36
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:46,604
So, here, we have this. 
We can think of it as an update equation, 

37
00:02:46,604 --> 00:02:50,811
right? The next state is given by this 
equation and it's a function of the 

38
00:02:50,811 --> 00:02:54,877
current state. 
So, to see how the ball moves, let's 

39
00:02:54,877 --> 00:02:58,722
increment k. 
We started here at zero, now k=1, 

40
00:02:58,722 --> 00:03:03,797
we take the past state, and we add the 
current value of k. 

41
00:03:03,797 --> 00:03:10,752
Again, if we increment k to 2, we can see 
that we take our past state, we add two, 

42
00:03:10,752 --> 00:03:14,681
we get, 
we're now at x=3, right? And so forth. 

43
00:03:14,681 --> 00:03:20,232
So again, if we do it, and we can see 
that, as we move, the ball is moving 

44
00:03:20,232 --> 00:03:25,777
fast, you know, more blocks each time, 
so it's moving faster and faster. And 

45
00:03:25,777 --> 00:03:32,262
back to continuous time, we can see that 
this is actually the equation that tell 

46
00:03:32,262 --> 00:03:37,007
us how the ball is moving. 
It's speeding up as it goes along and 

47
00:03:37,007 --> 00:03:42,182
it's moving according to this equation x 
dot, and this, is a dynamical model. 

48
00:03:42,182 --> 00:03:47,762
In addition to this description, this 
update rule, this differential equation, 

49
00:03:47,762 --> 00:03:52,992
if we have an initial condition, so we 
know where our ball needs to start. 

50
00:03:52,992 --> 00:03:57,306
Let's see if I can play this again. 
We see that, this is what happens, 

51
00:03:57,306 --> 00:04:01,802
and so, we think of this as a dynamical 
model and this is how we want to think 

52
00:04:01,802 --> 00:04:04,668
about differential equations in this 
course. 

53
00:04:04,668 --> 00:04:08,148
So, an example. 
What should we see when we see this? The 

54
00:04:08,148 --> 00:04:11,998
first thing to do when we see a plot is 
always look at the axis. 

55
00:04:11,998 --> 00:04:14,862
We can see here that this is x versus 
time. 

56
00:04:14,862 --> 00:04:19,033
We can see that we start at some non-zero 
initial condition and we can see that 

57
00:04:19,033 --> 00:04:23,254
when that happens, we start to move and 
we move kind of, we, we don't move in a, 

58
00:04:23,254 --> 00:04:26,887
at a constant rate, right? 
If we moved at a constant rate, we would 

59
00:04:26,887 --> 00:04:31,227
see this straight line, but we can see 
that actually what's happening is we're 

60
00:04:31,227 --> 00:04:36,491
speeding up as we go, as time increases, 
and so, we can infer certain things about 

61
00:04:36,491 --> 00:04:40,885
what x dot looks like, then. 
Right? So x dot is going to be something 

62
00:04:40,885 --> 00:04:45,684
that increases with time. 
And, in fact, here, what we have is that 

63
00:04:45,684 --> 00:04:48,894
x dot is 2t. 
So this is at a plot that we just saw 

64
00:04:48,894 --> 00:04:54,360
animated with the pink ball. 
So, next, what we might see, is we might 

65
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:59,658
be presented with a,a dynamical model. 
What should be think when we see this? 

66
00:04:59,658 --> 00:05:05,081
Well, first of all, these x of t's, 
we'll sometimes just write them as x as a 

67
00:05:05,081 --> 00:05:09,512
sort of shorthand. 
And, what we can try to ask about this 

68
00:05:09,512 --> 00:05:15,662
model is what does x of t look like? So, 
what's the trajectory described by this 

69
00:05:15,662 --> 00:05:21,497
system? And, what happens at time equal 
to infinity, right? And that means, what 

70
00:05:21,497 --> 00:05:27,007
happens after a long time to this system? 
So, if we want to find x of t, we just 

71
00:05:27,007 --> 00:05:32,502
need to integrate our differential 
equation or sometimes what we can do is 

72
00:05:32,502 --> 00:05:37,712
just guess a trajectory a form for x of 
t, and then check, and the way you check 

73
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:42,567
is just by differentiating. 
So here, this is pretty easy, right? 

74
00:05:42,567 --> 00:05:46,427
We can see that when we differentiate 
x^2/2, we get x. 

75
00:05:46,427 --> 00:05:51,212
So this is the form of x of t. 
It's going to be some kind of problem, 

76
00:05:51,212 --> 00:05:54,325
right? 
And the second thing that we might ask 

77
00:05:54,325 --> 00:05:58,861
this idea of what happens long term to 
the system is just a matter of 

78
00:05:58,861 --> 00:06:01,908
considering what happens when x stops 
moving? 

79
00:06:01,908 --> 00:06:07,224
Because when x stops moving, we're stuck, 
right? That's where our system ends up. 

80
00:06:07,224 --> 00:06:12,042
So, if we plug in what it means for x to 
stop moving is for x dot to be zero. 

81
00:06:12,042 --> 00:06:15,372
If we plug this in to our dynamical 
system, 

82
00:06:15,372 --> 00:06:21,831
we find that that means that x=0. 
So long term with this system, what's 

83
00:06:21,831 --> 00:06:27,121
going to happen is x is going to rest at 
zero and we call this an equilibrium 

84
00:06:27,121 --> 00:06:30,778
point, 
because the system isn't moving at this 

85
00:06:30,778 --> 00:06:33,002
point. 
So, that wraps up our lecture. 

86
00:06:33,002 --> 00:06:38,319
good luck with Quiz 1, and I'll see you 
at the forums.

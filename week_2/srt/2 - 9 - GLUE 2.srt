00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,922
Hello welcome to our second Glue Lecture.
I hope everyone is enjoying the course so

2
00:00:05,934 --> 00:00:11,793
far. today's lecture is going to discuss
robot models, which is kind of what we've

3
00:00:12,083 --> 00:00:17,739
been talking about here in module two. and
again, this is kind of tailored to help

4
00:00:17,751 --> 00:00:23,340
with quiz two. So, in lecture this week we
saw, Dr. Egarsteade showed two different

5
00:00:23,352 --> 00:00:28,602
models for our robot. And this, the same
differential drive robot and so I kind of

6
00:00:29,002 --> 00:00:33,890
want to get into before I go into
examples, why we use those two different

7
00:00:33,902 --> 00:00:38,815
models and why they're useful and how
should kind of think about them and it

8
00:00:38,827 --> 00:00:44,454
should help you on the quiz. So what if,
and you know, in class, we discussed this

9
00:00:44,466 --> 00:00:50,027
differential-drive robot, but what if we
had a dancing robot, okay? This, this

10
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:55,522
humanoid robot, now has 25 degrees of
freedom, and has these arms, these knees,

11
00:00:55,637 --> 00:01:01,223
shoulders. It's, it's very articulated.
And this is a lot to think about, right?

12
00:01:01,338 --> 00:01:06,232
So. I certainly, if I'm thinking about how
I might want a robot to dance, I don't

13
00:01:06,244 --> 00:01:11,022
know exactly how I want every wrist, the
ankle, the hips, that would be kind of a

14
00:01:11,034 --> 00:01:15,539
lot to coordinate for me, and it would
make this project very hard. So let's

15
00:01:15,551 --> 00:01:20,361
imagine that instead what we're thinking
about is just how we want the robot to be

16
00:01:20,373 --> 00:01:24,994
dancing. Some style of movement that we
want it to use. This is kind of an easy

17
00:01:25,006 --> 00:01:29,291
thing to think about, and then we can
imagine In that somehow I have made a

18
00:01:29,303 --> 00:01:33,857
mapping between style of dancing and joint
angles and then somewhere else I might

19
00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:39,218
have in I think of that as this pink box
here and then somewhere else I have kind

20
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:43,598
of a mapping between angles and forces and
exactly what controller needs to be

21
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:48,082
running on the robot. Then this task is
very easy, right? We just think of desired

22
00:01:48,094 --> 00:01:52,418
dancing style. We tell that, and how that
should change over time. And then these

23
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:56,638
maps take care of exactly what's going on
under the hood. So we think of these as

24
00:01:56,650 --> 00:02:01,065
layers of abstraction that are easier to
work with than others. Of course, this one

25
00:02:01,077 --> 00:02:07,414
is necessary. We need to tell that the
motors that are controlling these joint s

26
00:02:07,414 --> 00:02:13,274
what to do, but from a planning standpoint
this is easier, right. Now, in this case

27
00:02:13,286 --> 00:02:18,755
this, this green map is provided by the
manufacturer of this robot, which is a,

28
00:02:18,871 --> 00:02:24,748
now robot. This might be harder to come
by, but Let's say we have it and just kind

29
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:30,179
of as a example of what we might think.
Let's say we want the robot to be, be

30
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:36,795
cheer leading. We'd specify that at this
end. now comes to movement that we think

31
00:02:36,807 --> 00:02:43,034
kind of represents the style of movement
And if I change that, maybe I change the

32
00:02:43,046 --> 00:02:49,052
way the robot's moving. Again, this map
and this map are taking care of kind of

33
00:02:49,064 --> 00:02:55,232
all the hard stuff and then all I have to
think about is this guy. So this kind of a

34
00:02:55,244 --> 00:03:00,129
really Involved an example. Kind of an
unusual example, but it gets this idea

35
00:03:00,141 --> 00:03:04,931
that here's the layer of attraction where
we want to be using. If we make this 1

36
00:03:04,943 --> 00:03:10,141
time mapping, between the stylus movement
to join angles, to join forces, we get off

37
00:03:10,153 --> 00:03:15,420
this kind of movement. And we have this
same situation with the differential drive

38
00:03:15,432 --> 00:03:19,464
robot from class. So here's kind of a
close-up of that robot.

39
00:03:19,467 --> 00:03:23,970
It has these two wheels underneath that
can turn independently of each other. That

40
00:03:23,982 --> 00:03:28,820
what makes it differential drive. That's
what makes it move. Kind of hard to think

41
00:03:28,832 --> 00:03:34,345
about, we don't, you know, telling exactly
which wheel should move exactly how at

42
00:03:34,357 --> 00:03:39,145
every moment would be kind of hard. We
really just want to think about the

43
00:03:39,157 --> 00:03:44,570
resulting behavior. So we think about that
in terms of these V and W, the speed of

44
00:03:44,582 --> 00:03:49,360
the robot and how it's turning. Right?
That can make sense. It's similar to

45
00:03:49,372 --> 00:03:53,611
driving a car. Which is a experience that
we kind of all share. And now, we still

46
00:03:53,623 --> 00:03:57,669
somehow need to get out exactly what the
wheels should be doing. Right? The

47
00:03:57,681 --> 00:04:02,106
velocities, the distance they should be
traveling. And then, somehow, we have to

48
00:04:02,118 --> 00:04:05,996
relate that to actually what we're
measuring on the robot, right? These

49
00:04:06,008 --> 00:04:10,858
encoder ticks. And so we accomplish that
through odometry. And we used these two

50
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:16,680
maps to kind of have this, so that we can
think about programming the robot in terms

51
00:04:16,692 --> 00:04:22,111
of these. An d out, we get implemental,
implementable commands for the robot.

52
00:04:22,227 --> 00:04:27,717
Right? So we saw these maps in class. We
saw lots of maps. And what the maps are,

53
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:33,608
right, are just equations that relate. The
high level variables to, or the high level

54
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:38,389
variables here, sorry V and W to the low
level variables here VR and VL, the

55
00:04:38,401 --> 00:04:42,811
velocity of each wheel. Right.
And we can relate the velocity of each

56
00:04:42,823 --> 00:04:48,129
wheel to the distance of each wheel.
That's just a, Normal equation right, rate

57
00:04:48,141 --> 00:04:52,894
of change. And here, then we can take
those distances and relate it to ticks. So

58
00:04:52,906 --> 00:04:57,650
we can think of these equations now as
maps that let us move between these layers

59
00:04:57,662 --> 00:05:02,522
of abstraction. And this is exactly what
some of the questions on the home, on the

60
00:05:02,534 --> 00:05:07,253
quiz are going to ask. Going back and
forth between these layers of abstraction

61
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:12,750
and it's just a matter of implementing the
correct equations. So what if we have this

62
00:05:12,762 --> 00:05:18,805
question or approach this question. What
happens to the robot, what's the resulting

63
00:05:18,817 --> 00:05:24,320
behavior if z is zero and w is constant?
So this is kind of going from this high

64
00:05:24,332 --> 00:05:29,790
level behavior up here down to what's
exactly happening on the wheels at this

65
00:05:29,802 --> 00:05:35,544
end. And all we need to do is use these
basic equations that I had on the last

66
00:05:35,556 --> 00:05:42,507
light as well and that , introduced in
lecture. We can fill in for v being 0 for

67
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:48,468
the left and the right and for w as being
sub constant. And now you see that you're

68
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:53,309
going to get constant speed for both the
left and the right, and one is just going

69
00:05:53,321 --> 00:05:58,150
to be the negative of the other. So one
wheel's going forward, and one wheel's

70
00:05:58,162 --> 00:06:02,993
going backwards. So what's happening to
the robot? This might be easy to intuit

71
00:06:03,005 --> 00:06:07,031
here, right? Because we know that v is
zero, and if w is constant, we are

72
00:06:07,043 --> 00:06:11,701
turning. But here you can see exactly how
that contributes to the velocities of each

73
00:06:11,713 --> 00:06:16,033
wheel. So if you need a further guide,
this is how to do it. We can see that the

74
00:06:16,045 --> 00:06:20,265
robot is just spinning around, right.
Spin, spin, spin, right. One wheels

75
00:06:20,277 --> 00:06:25,157
turning forward, one wheels turning
backwards, and it spins. So, kind of going

76
00:06:25,169 --> 00:06:31,045
from the other direction, now we're given
information about exactly what the wheels

77
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:36,462
are doing. Right? We have some specifics
about this robot. Now, what happens,

78
00:06:36,577 --> 00:06:42,085
what's the high level behavior that we get
out of it? So we can think about going

79
00:06:42,097 --> 00:06:47,476
from this direction. We start here. With
information about the ticks on the

80
00:06:47,488 --> 00:06:53,189
encoders. We use odometry to relate that
to wheel velocities. And then we're going

81
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:58,542
to know what's happening on the, on the
robot. So we had these equations here for,

82
00:06:58,656 --> 00:07:04,625
to relate ticks to distance. So if we plug
in our number of ticks in our. Parameters,

83
00:07:04,754 --> 00:07:11,406
radius of the wheel, number of ticks per
lo, per rotation of the wheel. We get that

84
00:07:11,418 --> 00:07:17,577
the distance the right wheel travels is
ten, and that should actually be ten

85
00:07:17,589 --> 00:07:24,117
inches, right? And the distance for the
left wheel is six. Now we'll call another

86
00:07:24,129 --> 00:07:30,211
set of equations, right. This is the set
of equations that lets us figure out where

87
00:07:30,223 --> 00:07:36,239
in terms of x, y, and fee, we are based on
the distances the wheels have turned. So

88
00:07:36,251 --> 00:07:42,059
it's just a matter of plugging in from
here again. We take this, distance right,

89
00:07:42,179 --> 00:07:49,180
distance left, we compute Dc right?
With this equation here and we get that C

90
00:07:49,192 --> 00:07:55,615
is 2 radiants and we plug that into this
equation and we get an x and y position.

91
00:07:55,747 --> 00:08:02,640
Our previous position was zero and updated
equations tells us that these terms are

92
00:08:02,652 --> 00:08:08,592
what, are what is happened to the robot.
So, for the rest of the quiz, it's really

93
00:08:08,604 --> 00:08:13,270
just a matter of kind of imagining the
robot in each of those scenarios, and

94
00:08:13,282 --> 00:08:18,249
seeing what happens. Just think through
them, and I think you'll be great. Good

95
00:08:18,261 --> 00:08:21,171
luck on the quiz, and I'll see you at the
forums.
